## Project 1 - Explore weather trends

This project explores the fluctuations of the average weather temperature in the world and two other cities : Sidney and Brussels where I'm currently living. From the comparison I identified few trends and proposed some possible explorations to go further in the explaination of the trends.

## Project 2 - Investigate a Dataset

This analysis on movie data aims to figure out over the past six decades :

* what are the most popular genres over the years
* what are the characteristic of the most profitable movies
* do most popular genres make more profit  

This investigation is based on a cleansed dataset which originally comes from [Kaggle - TMDb movie metadata](https://www.kaggle.com/tmdb/tmdb-movie-metadata)

After completing the project, I learn how to:

* Know all the steps involved in a typical data analysis process
* Be comfortable posing questions that can be answered with a given dataset and then answering those questions
* Know how to investigate problems in a dataset and wrangle the data into a format you can use
* Have experience communicating the results of your analysis
* Be able to use vectorized operations in NumPy and pandas to speed up your data analysis code
*Be familiar with pandas' Series and DataFrame objects, which let you access your data more conveniently
* Know how to use Matplotlib to produce plots showing your findings

## Project 3 - Analyze A/B Test Results

A/B tests are very commonly performed by data analysts and data scientists. 

This project aim at understand the results of an A/B test run by an e-commerce website. The company has developed a new web page in order to try and increase the number of users who "convert," meaning the number of users who decide to pay for the company's product. The final purpose is to decide rather or not to release the new design because it should lead to a higher conversion rate.

After completing the project, I learn:
* how I can use several "tools" to analyze observations: Probability, statitics and supervised traineing
* how they differ one from another and when one is more relevant.
